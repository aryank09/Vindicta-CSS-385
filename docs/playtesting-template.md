# Playtesting Report Templates

Use these templates to structure your playtesting sections:

## Early Development Playtest Template

**Development Phase:** [Week X] - [Brief phase description]
**Test Method:** [In-person observation / Remote screen share / Survey-based]
**Participants:** [Number] players ([Demographics: age range, gaming experience, major/background])

### Sample Content:
```
Development Phase: Core mechanics implementation (Week 3)
Test Method: In-person observation with think-aloud protocol
Participants: 5 students (3 CS majors, 2 non-CS), ages 19-22, mixed gaming experience
```

**Key Feedback:**
- [Specific feedback point 1 - what players said/did]
- [Specific feedback point 2 - observations about confusion/difficulty]
- [Specific feedback point 3 - positive reactions or suggestions]

**Changes Made:**
- [Specific change 1 based on feedback]
- [Specific change 2 with reasoning]

### Example:
```
Key Feedback:
- Players struggled to understand the jump mechanic timing (3/5 failed tutorial)
- Controls felt "floaty" and imprecise according to 4/5 players
- Visual feedback for collectibles was too subtle (players missed 60% of items)

Changes Made:
- Reduced jump gravity by 20% and added coyote time for more forgiving jumps
- Added particle effects and sound cues for all collectible interactions
```

## Mid-Development Playtest Template

**Development Phase:** [Week X] - [Phase description]
**Test Method:** [Testing approach]
**Participants:** [Number and details]

**Key Feedback:**
- [UI/UX related feedback]
- [Level design feedback]  
- [Progression/difficulty feedback]

**Changes Made:**
- [Interface improvements]
- [Level adjustments]

## Final Playtest Template (Detailed)

**Development Phase:** Polish and final adjustments (Week 9)
**Test Method:** Structured gameplay sessions with post-game surveys  
**Participants:** [12+] players with diverse demographics and gaming experience

### Participant Demographics:
- Age range: [X-Y years]
- Gaming experience: [X beginners, Y intermediate, Z experienced]
- Platforms: [PC/Console/Mobile preferences]

### Detailed Feedback Categories:

**Gameplay (Average: X/5)**
- [Specific mechanic feedback]
- [Difficulty curve comments]
- [Engagement/fun factor]

**Controls (Average: X/5)**  
- [Responsiveness feedback]
- [Learning curve observations]
- [Accessibility concerns]

**Visuals (Average: X/5)**
- [Art style reception]
- [UI clarity feedback]
- [Performance observations]

**Overall Fun (Average: X/5)**
- [Memorable moments]
- [Replay interest]
- [Recommendation likelihood]

### Sample Survey Questions:
1. Rate the overall fun factor (1-5)
2. How intuitive were the controls? (1-5)
3. What was your favorite moment in the game?
4. What frustrated you the most?
5. Would you recommend this to a friend? (Yes/No/Maybe)
6. If you could change one thing, what would it be?

### Quantitative Results Example:
```
- Average play session: 12 minutes
- Tutorial completion rate: 92%  
- Level 1 completion rate: 83%
- Players who reached end: 67%
- Overall satisfaction: 4.2/5
```

### Planned Changes:
- [High priority fix based on feedback]
- [Medium priority improvement]  
- [Nice-to-have enhancement]

### Future Recommendations:
- [Suggestion for other developers]
- [What you'd do differently next time]
- [Features to add with more time]

## Tips for Good Playtesting Reports

### What to Include:
- Specific player quotes (with permission)
- Quantitative data when available
- Observable behaviors, not just opinions
- Both positive and negative feedback
- Clear connection between feedback and changes

### What to Avoid:
- Vague statements like "players liked it"
- Only positive feedback
- Changes that weren't actually implemented
- Assuming what players meant without asking

### Example Quotes:
- "I kept pressing space but nothing happened" (control responsiveness)
- "I didn't know I could do that until level 3" (tutorial clarity)
- "This part made me want to keep playing" (engagement)
- "I got stuck here for 5 minutes" (difficulty spike)

### Measuring Success:
- Task completion rates
- Time to complete sections  
- Number of failed attempts
- Player retention through levels
- Subjective satisfaction scores
- Willingness to recommend

## Integration with Development Process

Show how playtesting influenced your development:

1. **Early Test → Core Changes:** How initial feedback shaped fundamental mechanics
2. **Mid Test → Polish Focus:** How feedback guided UI/UX improvements  
3. **Final Test → Launch Readiness:** How final feedback confirmed game quality

This demonstrates iterative design and user-centered development approach.
